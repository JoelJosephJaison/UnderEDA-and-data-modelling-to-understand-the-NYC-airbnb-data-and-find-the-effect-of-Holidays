# Reflective of the Project:

 <font size="4">The objective of this project is to conduct an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a chosen dataset that satisfies specific data requirements. The EDA will involve loading and parsing the data into R, visualizing and exploring the variation in the variables, identifying typical and unusual values, and investigating covariation between the variables. The project will also involve generating questions about the dataset to guide further analysis.</font>

### Format:


```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(knitr)

Variables <- c("id","name","host_id","host_name","neighbourhood_group","neighbourhood","latitude","longitude","room_type","price","minimum_nights","number_of_reviews","last_review","reviews_per_month","calculated_host_listings_count","availability_365")

Description <- c("ID number of the listing","Name of the listing","ID number of the host","Name of the host","Boroughs in which the listing is located","Neighborhood in which the listing is located","Latitude of the listing","Longitude of the listing","Type of room (e.g. Entire home/apt, Private room)","Price per night","Minimum number of nights for a stay","Number of reviews for the listing","Date of the latest review","Number of reviews per month","Number of listings by the same host","Number of days in the year that the listing is available")

datatable <- data.frame(Variables,Description)

kable(datatable)
```

# Task 1:

### 1.Parsing Data
```{r}
airbnb <- read.csv("C:/Users/joelj/OneDrive/Desktop/AB_NYC_2019.csv")

```

 <font size="4">This line of code loads the data stored in the file "AB_NYC_2019.csv" into R as a dataframe and assigns it to the variable name "airbnb".This line of code assumes that our data set is in .csv format. The filepath of the file is specified as "C:/Users/joelj/OneDrive/Desktop/" and may need to be adjusted depending on where the file is located on the user's computer. Once loaded, the data can be manipulated and analyzed using various R functions and packages.</font>

### 2. Requirements
```{r }
str(airbnb)
table(airbnb$neighbourhood_group)
```
 <font size="4">Using the str() function , we can see the structure of the dataset. Here we can see that:

1. There is 48895 observations.

2. There are 3 numerical variables which are latitude, longitude and reviews_per_month

3. There are 2 categorical variables which are neighbourhood_group and room_type

4. There are 16 variables in total 

Additionally , We see that the variable last_review consists of dates 

Therefore this dataset, satisfies all our requirements  
</font>


# Task 2:

### 1. Plots of Variation of Variables 


```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="75%"}
ggplot(data = airbnb) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = "", fill = neighbourhood_group),color = "white") + coord_polar(theta = "y") + labs(title="Plot 1:Distribution of Airbnbs in 5 boroughs of NYC")

```

![Figure 3: Map with the most famous attractions in New York City(3)](C:/Users/joelj/OneDrive/Desktop/New-York-City-Top-Attractions-Image-courtesy-of-Musement-1920x1600.jpg){width=70% #figure-3}

 <font size="4">This is a polar bar chart which provides a visualization of the distribution of airbnb listings in New York City. Manhattan has the largest number of airbnb listing among all the neighbourhoods. It was found from [Figure 2](#figure-2) that Manhattan is one of the closest borough in New York which has easy access to the Statue of Liberty which is one of the most famous attractions in The United States. And from [Figure 3](#figure-3) we can see that Manhattan has other important attractions like the Empire State Building, Rockfeller Center and even includes Times Square where about 330,000 people pass through it on a daily basis(4). We also see that distribution in Brooklyn is almost equal to that of Manhattan,  this is because Brooklyn has some famous attractions like the Brooklyn Bridge ([Figure 3](#figure-3)). But surely other factors like Low Seasonality, Lenient Airbnb Laws and Regulations,Access to Public Transportation and Amenities and many others could also be a factor to the distribution of airbnbs in NYC but in this project we focus on just the proximity to famous attractions(5) </font>
 
```{r,echo=FALSE}
df <- count(airbnb,neighbourhood_group,neighbourhood)
dfbrooklyn <- df[49:95,]
dfbrooklyn <- dfbrooklyn[order(dfbrooklyn$n,decreasing = TRUE),]

ggplot(data = top10brooklyn)+geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = neighbourhood,y = n),stat = "identity")+coord_flip()+labs(title = "Plot 2:Top 10 neighbourhoods and their count in Brooklyn")

![Figure 5: Map of Brooklyn and its proximity to Liberty Island(7)](C:/Users/joelj/OneDrive/Desktop/LMandBrooklynMap.jpg){width=70% #figure-5}


<font size="4"> To further this analysis, I looked into a bar graph of the Top 10 neighbourhoods based on the largest number of airbnbs in Brooklyn. From this plot I was able to understand that Bedford-Stuyvesant, Willamsburg and Bushwick have very high distribution compared to the other neighbourhoods and on further analysis I was able to understand that all these three neighbourhoods are very close to Manhattan([Figure 4](#figure-4)).From this I came to the conclusion that people tend to stay in Brooklyn and then travel all the way to Manhattan instead of staying directly at Manhattan. But why would people tend to stay in Brooklyn rather than staying in Manhattan directly? This will be discussed later in this project. Another observation that can be found from [Figure 5](#figure-5) is that neighbourhoods from areas 2 and 6 are very close to the Liberty Island, then surely people would want to travel from Brooklyn to Liberty Island. But why aren't these neighbourhoods in the top 10 ?   </font>

```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(airbnb,neighbourhood %in% c("Brooklyn Heights", "Prospect Heights","DUMBO","Carroll Gardens","Downtown Brooklyn","Fort Greene","Cobble Hill","Vinegar Hill","Fulton Mall","Clinton Hill","Red Hook","Gowanus"),neighbourhood_group=="Brooklyn"))+geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = neighbourhood))+coord_flip()+labs(title = "Plot 3: Count of Airbnbs in Area 2 and 6 from Figure 4 ")

```

<font size = "4">I created a plot to analyze why these two specific areas were not included in the top 10 list. The plot revealed that the count of certain attributes was significantly lower in these areas, which explains why they did not receive a higher ranking. But again why isn't it more in number especially because of the proximity to Liberty Island. Further examination, specifically [Figure 2](#figure-2), indicated that the transportation options available to Liberty Island were only accessible from New Jersey or Manhattan, not Brooklyn. This lack of transportation connection to Liberty Island may explain why there is no incentive for individuals to reside in Brooklyn if their main interest is visiting Liberty Island.</font>


```{r,echo=FALSE}
df <- count(airbnb,neighbourhood_group,neighbourhood)
dfqueens <- df[128:178,]
dfqueens <- dfqueens[order(dfqueens$n,decreasing = TRUE),]
top10queens <- dfqueens[1:10,]

ggplot(data =top10queens) + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = neighbourhood,y = n),stat = "identity")+ coord_flip()+labs(title = "Plot 4:Top 10 neighbourhoods and their count in Queens")

```

![Figure 6: Map with the neighbourhoods in Queens(8)](C:/Users/joelj/OneDrive/Desktop/stock-vector-new-york-districts-queens-207331579.jpg){width=70% #figure-6}


<font size="4">We were able to find some good relations between neighbourhoods of Brooklyn with Manhattan , thereby I tried to find such variations in other neighbourhood groups. When we analyze on the neighbourhoods in Queens, we find that the same kind of observations are found here, like the fact that Astoria and Long Island City has highest distribution among the top neighbourhoods in Queens. And these two neighbourhoods are close to Manhattan ([Figure 6](#figure-6)). Again the same factor of proximity to Manhattan makes this place more attractive than the other neighbourhoods.</font> 


```{r,echo=FALSE}
df <- count(airbnb,neighbourhood_group,neighbourhood)
dfbronx <- df[1:48,]
dfbronx <- dfbronx[order(dfbronx$n,decreasing = TRUE),]
top10bronx <- dfbronx[1:10,]
ggplot(data = top10bronx)+geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = neighbourhood,y = n),stat = "identity")+coord_flip()+labs(title = "Plot 5:Top 10 neighbourhoods and their count in Bronx")

```

![Figure :9 Map Showing the three different divisions of Manhattan. (11)](C:/Users/joelj/OneDrive/Desktop/segregation of Manhattan.webp){width=70% #figure-9}



<font size="4"> I was curious if the same would happen in Bronx just like in Brooklyn and Queens . But what I had found is that the number of airbnbs in places like Mott Haven and Port Morris which are close to Manhattan ([Figure 7](#figure-7)) are significant but places like Fordham and Kingsbridge are a bit more higher . To see why this is happening , we look into [Figure 3](#figure-3), where we see that one of the famous attractions in NYC is the Bronx Zoo and if we look into [Figure 8](#figure-8) we see that Fordham and Kingsbridge are very close to Bronx Zoo and thereby people tend to stay in these neighbourhoods. Also another reason why people would not want to stay in neighbourhoods in Bronx which are near to the Manhattan is that they are located more towards the upper Manhattan where there are very less number of attractions as compared to that in lower or middle Manhattan ([Figure 3](#figure-3) and [Figure 9](#figure-9)) .But again why would people tend to stay in Brooklyn or Queens to go to Manhattan rather than staying right at Manhattan ? </font>

 



### 2. Plots of Covariation of Variables
```{r,echo=FALSE}
ggplot(data = filter(airbnb,price < 500))+ geom_density(mapping= aes(x = price,color = neighbourhood_group))+labs(title = "Plot 6:Price Density by Neighborhood Group for Airbnb Listings under $500 ")
```

<font size = "4">To further understand why people tend to stay in Queens or Brooklyn rather than staying in Manhattan , I looked into a density plot with price less than 500 against each neighbourhood group . From this I was able to understand that Manhattan has a higher density of prices between 100 and 200 which means that the price is relatively more expensive compared to the other boroughs. Queens and Brooklyn have similar density curves, which means that they have a similar distribution but there is a slight peak density for Queens indicating that listings in Queens tend to be slightly more affordable than Brooklyn. And this solves our dilemma about why people tend to stay in Brooklyn and Queens rather than directly staying in Manhattan because staying in Brooklyn and Queens is less expensive and probably traveling to Manhattan will be very cheap. But again if we look at the count of the number of airbnbs in Brooklyn and Queens , we see that the number of Airbnbs in Willamsburg is a bit less than 4000 units and in Astoria is only a bit more than 750 (Plot 2 and Plot 4)). This is because Astoria is connected to Midtown Manhattan and if we look at [Figure 3](#figure-3) we see that there are less number of famous attractions in Midtown Manhattan and on the other hand Brooklyn is connected to lower Manhattan which contains most of the famous attractions ([Figure 9](#figure-9)).Bronx and Staten Island have relatively fewer listings compared to other neighborhood groups, and their density curves are lower than others. But if we look back again at [Figure 3](#figure-3) we see that there is barely any attractions in Staten Island and there is one famous attraction in Bronx which is the Bronx Zoo, then why is the price in Staten Island almost similar to that of Bronx?</font>




```{r,echo=FALSE,warning=FALSE}
ggplot(data = airbnb) + geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = reorder(neighbourhood_group, availability_365, FUN = median), y = availability_365))+coord_flip()+labs(title = "Plot 7:Distribution of Yearly Availability for Airbnb Listings in Different Neighbourhood Groups.")
```

 <font size="4">To answer this question we look at a box plot of the availability of Airbnb listings for each neighbourhood group, where the x-axis represents the neighbourhood group and the y-axis represents the availability in days. Here we see that Staten Island has a very high availability throughout the year compared to that of the other boroughs. This solves our problem as we can identify from Plot 1 that the distribution in Staten Island is very low, this in turn means that the supply of Airbnbs in Staten Island is less and when there is a very low supply , there will surely be a high demand and thereby prices will increase. From this we are able to understand why prices in Staten Island is quite similar to that in Bronx.</font>
 

### Questions:

<font size="4">

1) How many Airbnb hosts in New York City have multiple listings?

2) How has the number of Airbnb listings in New York City changed over time?

3) What is the average number of reviews for Airbnb properties in New York City?

4) Are there any seasonal patterns in Airbnb booking patterns in New York City?
